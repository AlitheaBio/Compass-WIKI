# Publishing Modules with GitHub (Moved)

The detailed GHCR and GitHub Actions flows now live in [ci_cd_for_modules.md](./ci_cd/ci_cd_for_modules.md). Use that guide alongside the [Module developer handbook](./handbook.md#6-build-push-publish) for end-to-end steps (scaffold → test → build → publish).

This file remains only as a redirect for legacy links.
